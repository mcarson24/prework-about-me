      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring web developer who loves the idea of being able to use technology to solve both simple and complex problems.</p>

      <p>Philadelphia, PA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy reading, usually fantasy novels and biographies or walking my pitbull, Duchess. In meiner Freizeit, lerne ich auch gern Deutsch.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would like to work at a company which has a mission that I believe and believes in its employees. Also, I'd like to work with hard working, talented, and driven people who share similar passions as me.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was first introduced to web development while I attended Temple University from 2007 until 2012, where I graduated with a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems and Accounting. Recently, after feeling dissatisfied with my career trajectory, I rediscovered my passion for web development and recommitted myself to learning it in order to pursue a more fulfilling and gratifying career.</p>
